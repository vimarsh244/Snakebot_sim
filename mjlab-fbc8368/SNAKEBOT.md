# Snakebot v2 goal-reaching in mjlab

This is the authoritative guide for the current Snakebot policy in this repository.

## Current task

- Task ID: `Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2`
- Experiment directory: `snakebot_locomotion_v2/`
- Purpose: navigate to COM-relative XY goals

The v2 environment starts from `make_velocity_env_cfg()` only to reuse common
scene defaults. It replaces the robot, commands, observations, rewards, events,
and terminations with goal-reaching behavior. It does not load the velocity
policy.

## Authoritative robot and scene

The v2 task is registered in
`src/mjlab/tasks/locomotion/config/snakebot_v2/__init__.py` and constructed by
`snakebot_locomotion_v2_flat_cfg()`.

The scene is composed as follows:

1. Flat plane terrain, with no terrain generator or height scanner.
2. One Snakebot entity created by `get_snakebot_robot_cfg()`.
3. The robot loader reads:
   `src/mjlab/asset_zoo/robots/snakebot/xmls/chain_5.xml`.
4. Meshes are loaded from the adjacent `xmls/meshes/` directory.

The robot has five modules and ten position-controlled joints:
`m[1-5]_Revolute-15` and `m[1-5]_Revolute-16`.

## Setup

From outside the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vimarsh244/Snakebot_sim.git
cd Snakebot_sim/mjlab-fbc8368
uv sync
```

For an existing checkout:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd mjlab-fbc8368
uv sync
```

The project environment is `mjlab-fbc8368/.venv`. Prefer `uv run ...` so the
correct interpreter and dependencies are selected automatically.

Requirements:

- Python 3.10–3.13.
- NVIDIA GPU and CUDA for practical training.
- Node 20.19+ for the mjswan frontend toolchain.

Confirm the registered tasks:

```bash
uv run list_envs --keyword Snakebot
```

## Current v2 environment

### Goal behavior

- Goals are sampled relative to the full-robot center of mass, not the head.
- Directions are balanced across all four XY quadrants.
- Goal-distance curriculum: `0.50`–`3.00 m`.
- Initial curriculum maximum: `0.65 m`.
- Curriculum reaches the full range after `2,000,000` environment steps.
- Goal completion/episode stopping radius: `0.13 m` from robot COM.
- Training episode limit: `75 s`.
- Control frequency: `20 Hz`.

### Simulation

| Setting | v2 value |
| --- | ---: |
| Physics timestep | `0.0025 s` |
| Control decimation | `20` |
| Control timestep | `0.05 s` |
| Solver | Newton |
| Integrator | implicitfast |
| Solver iterations | `120` |
| Line-search iterations | `40` |
| `impratio` | `12.0` |
| CCD iterations | `120` |
| `njmax` | `12000` |
| `nconmax` | `1200` |

### Policy interface

The actor consumes 126 values and produces ten joint-position actions.

| Actor observation | Size |
| --- | ---: |
| Phase clock | 2 |
| Goal vector in body frame | 2 |
| Heading to goal | 2 |
| Joint-position history, 3 frames | 30 |
| Joint-velocity history, 3 frames | 30 |
| Action history, 3 frames | 30 |
| Five module linear velocities in root frame | 15 |
| Five module angular velocities in root frame | 15 |
| **Total** | **126** |

The critic uses 182 values: the actor observations plus goal distance, module
positions/velocities, and joint efforts. Actions use a `0.10 rad` scale and PPO
clips them to `0.9`.

### Main reward weights

| Reward | Weight |
| --- | ---: |
| Progress toward goal | `33.0` |
| Root velocity toward goal | `9.0` |
| COM velocity toward goal | `4.0` |
| Distance shaping | `4.5` |
| Goal reached bonus | `66.0` |
| Alive bonus | `0.3` |
| Stagnation | `-0.5` |
| Lateral slip | `-0.06` |
| Vertical velocity | `-0.08` |
| Yaw rate | `-0.06` |
| Action smoothness | `-0.015` |
| Control cost | `-0.003` |
| Joint-position limits | `-0.002` |

Training includes friction, inertia, joint, encoder, PD-gain, effort-limit, and
gentle post-settle push randomization. Play mode disables observation corruption
and those randomization events.

## Train v2

Run commands from `mjlab-fbc8368/`.

Single GPU:

```bash
uv run train Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --env.scene.num-envs 2048
```

Choose a GPU or adjust parallelism:

```bash
uv run train Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --env.scene.num-envs 1024 \
  --gpu-ids 1

uv run train Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --env.scene.num-envs 4096 \
  --gpu-ids 0 1
```

Training logs go to:

```text
logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/<timestamp>/
```

Weights & Biases uses project `mjlab`. Authenticate once with `wandb login`.

Resume the latest matching local v2 checkpoint:

```bash
uv run train Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 --agent.resume
```

Resume a W&B checkpoint:

```bash
uv run train Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --agent.resume \
  --wandb-run-path ENTITY/mjlab/RUN_ID
```

## Known working model: model 1200

The checkpoint used for the committed evaluations is:

```text
logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/model_1200.pt
```

Its associated ONNX export is:

```text
logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/2026-03-10_19-34-58.onnx
```

Evidence that it is v2:

- Captured agent config says `experiment_name: snakebot_locomotion_v2`.
- ONNX input is `obs[1,126]`; output is `actions[1,10]`.
- ONNX observation names match the v2 phase, goal, history, and module-velocity terms.
- The checkpoint safely loads with `iter=1200`.
- Ten committed goal rollouts reached their targets.

The run continued through iteration 1292 and was then manually interrupted.
Iteration 1200 is the last saved checkpoint. It was trained with a `0.10 m`
reach threshold; current code uses `0.13 m`, which does not change the
observation or action architecture. The checkpoint was re-evaluated successfully
with the current stopping radius.

Checkpoints, ONNX files, W&B state, and logs are intentionally Git-ignored. A
fresh clone must download or copy the checkpoint/ONNX before using the commands
below. The evaluation report and videos are committed at
`docs/evaluations/snakebot_v2_model_1200/`.

## Play the v2 checkpoint

Native viewer:

```bash
uv run play Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/model_1200.pt
```

Viser web viewer:

```bash
uv run play Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --viewer viser \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/model_1200.pt
```

The goal is displayed as a red debug sphere.

Record a trained rollout:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run play Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/model_1200.pt \
  --video \
  --video-length 400
```

Videos are written beneath the selected run in `videos/play/`. Close the viewer
after the requested recording finishes.

## mjswan browser viewer

Initialize the pinned fork first:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Use the checkpoint and neighboring ONNX explicitly:

```bash
uv run play Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2 \
  --viewer mjswan \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/model_1200.pt
```

Or launch directly from ONNX:

```bash
uv run snakebot_mjswan \
  --onnx-file logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/2026-03-10_19-34-58/2026-03-10_19-34-58.onnx
```

Running `--viewer mjswan` without a checkpoint auto-selects the best local v2
ONNX using TensorBoard mean reward. It cannot auto-select anything in a fresh
clone until local v2 ONNX exports are present.

## Evaluation

The committed model-1200 evaluation contains four 0.60 m cardinal goals and six
random far goals from 1.57 m to 2.81 m. All ten reached the `0.13 m` stopping
radius within 24.5 seconds.

See:

- [Evaluation report](docs/evaluations/snakebot_v2_model_1200/README.md)
- [Embedded rollout gallery](README.md#snakebot-v2-goal-reaching)

## Troubleshooting

- If MuJoCo Warp runs out of constraint capacity, reduce
  `--env.scene.num-envs`.
- For headless video rendering, set `MUJOCO_GL=egl`.
- If mjswan dependencies or sources are missing, run
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- If playback reports an observation-size mismatch, confirm the task ID is
  exactly `Mjlab-Locomotion-Flat-Snakebot-v2` and the checkpoint comes from
  `snakebot_locomotion_v2/`.
- If no local checkpoint is available, use a W&B run path or copy the ignored
  run directory into `logs/rsl_rl/snakebot_locomotion_v2/`.
